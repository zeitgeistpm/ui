        These terms of use are entered into by and between You and Zeitgeist PM,
        LLC ("<strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "
        <strong>us</strong>"). The following terms and conditions, together with
        any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively,
        these "<strong>Terms of Use</strong>"), govern your access to and use of
        the website located at https://zeitgeist.pm (the &ldquo;

        the Company (collectively, the &ldquo;

        &rdquo;). The Marketplace generally hosts &lsquo;prediction
        markets&rsquo; which are categorical, scalar or combinatorial markets
        that test specific variables through interactions with users exchanging
        ZTG for other native outcome tokens on the platform in the various
        markets. The same prediction markets and methodologies are also used in
        the governance of the Marketplace.

        The Marketplace can be used for facilitating communication between two
        sets of users: market creators and market participants. Market creators
        may create markets of information on the Marketplace and market
        participants may peruse the markets created and available on the
        Marketplace and at their option, participate in each market. The actual
        contract is among the market participants. Company is not a party to the
        transaction, a seller, or a traditional auctioneer. Any guidance we
        provide as part of Marketplace, such as pricing, listing, and sourcing
        is for informational purposes only it is up to you to follow it or not.
        Also, Company has no control over and provides no guarantee related to:
        the existence, accuracy, quality, safety or legality of items advertised
        or user content. Market participants can interact with the Marketplace
        using digital items such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), smart contracts,
        cryptocurrencies, and other digital-based goods (collectively, &ldquo;
        <strong>Digital Assets</strong>&rdquo;). Some Digital Assets may relate
        or interface with distributed applications (&ldquo;
        <strong>Dapps</strong>&rdquo;) such as blockchains, the Polkadot
        Ecosystem, including Kusama, Zeitgeist Parachain, and other distributed
        ledger-type technologies.

        by the Company for violations of these Terms of Use or other applicable
        policies. If the user is an organization, you affirm you have the right,
        power, and authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of, and to

        agreement, you must not use the Marketplace or any of our services. By
        using this Marketplace, you represent and warrant that you are of legal
        age to form a binding contract with the Company and meet the foregoing
        eligibility requirements. You represent that you are legally permitted

          <u>Accessing the Marketplace and Account Security</u>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the Marketplace or some of the resources it offers, you may be
        asked to provide login information, including username and password
        (&ldquo;<strong>Login Info</strong>&rdquo;) and may include an Ethereum
        (or other blockchain&rsquo;s) wallet address (&ldquo;
        <strong>Wallet</strong>&rdquo;) to access, fund or receive disbursements
        from your account. It is your sole responsibility to maintain the
        security of your Login Info and your Wallet. If you lose access to your
        Wallet, a private key, password, or other method of securing your
        Wallet, any funds may be irretrievable, and we will be unable to assist
        you in any way. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all
        claims, whether known or unknown to you, against us, our affiliates and
        their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees,
        agents and representatives related to your use of any Wallet software,
        associated loss of funds, transaction failures, or any other defects
        that arise in the course of your use of your Wallet, including any
        losses that may obtain as a result of any failure in smart contracts
        made available on the Marketplace. You hereby accept responsibility for
        any activity transacted on the Marketplace through your Wallet.
        Additionally, you hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all
        claims, whether known or unknown to you, against us, our affiliates and
        their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees,
        agents and representatives related to any defects that arise in the
        course of your use of your Login Info and account. By using the
        Marketplace, you agree to be fully, independently and personally liable
        for each transaction made on the Marketplace by you, and you must make
        sure that you are the only person with access to your Login Info at all
        times. You hereby accept responsibility for any activity transacted on
        the Marketplace through your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use commercially reasonable technical and physical safeguards to
        make the Marketplace securely available to its users. However, given the
        inherent risk of transmitting information over the internet, we will not
        be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Marketplace is
        unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may
        restrict access to some parts of the Marketplace, or the entire
        Marketplace, to users. You are responsible for making all arrangements
        necessary for you to have access to the Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a condition of your use of the Marketplace that all the
        information you provide on the Marketplace is correct, current and
        complete. You agree that all information you provide to this Marketplace
        or otherwise, including but not limited to through the use of any
        interactive features on the Marketplace, is governed by our Privacy
        Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your
        information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

        <strong>
          <u>Fees</u>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;Fees are levied at the discretion of the market creator. In
        addition, certain transaction fees (e.g., gas fees) may be levied for
        use of the Marketplace. Fees may be changed at any time in our sole
        discretion. Where applicable, You agree to have the Company receive
        payments on your behalf for items you sell using the Marketplace, and
        manage settlement of those payments to You.
      </p>
      <p>
        If applicable, users may pay for items using payment methods such as the
        following (depending on availability): credit cards, Ethereum and other
        blockchains and related cryptocurrencies, smart contracts,
        PayPal&trade;, Google Pay&trade;, debit cards, Company coupons, and
        other similar payment methods. Company may modify the type of payment
        methods available to you at its own discretion. To the extent you
        interact through the Marketplace with smart contracts, you acknowledge
        that such contracts are binding upon you and that the counterparty to
        the contract is a third-party marketplace participant, not Company or
        our affiliates. The contract among the various users, including market
        creators and market participants, for the exchange of ZTG for outcome
        asset tokens is directly concluded among those users, even if the
        Company provides payment-related services to assist in concluding the
        purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users wishing to receive funds as part of any Marketplace transaction
        must have a financial account on file that is operable to receive funds.
        Financial accounts can include (depending on availability): bank
        accounts, blockchain addresses, and similar methods of receiving
        payment. Company may modify the type of financial accounts available to
        You at its own discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set up a financial account or payment method, you may be required to
        provide us with all necessary information for the purposes of: verifying
        your identity, complying with applicable laws, managing settlements of
        your purchases, and assessing fraud and risk. For individuals, this
        information may include at least, your full name, address, phone number,
        date of birth, taxpayer identification number, bank account information,
        and a form of government-issued identification. For businesses, this
        information may include, at least, full business name, address, phone
        number, entity type, bank account information, tax identification
        number, and business number, in addition to details regarding your
        beneficial owner(s), director(s), officer(s), authorized representative,
        and/or primary contact, such as name, contact information, nationality,
        title, and government-issued identification. You understand that Company
        may be unable to settle your transactions or provide tax documentation
        if you do not provide or timely update your contact information and
        other requested data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use third-party payment services providers, such as your payment
        methods or financial accounts, to assist us in providing payment
        capabilities (such as companies that process payments and disburse
        settlements, perform risk assessments or compliance checks, verify
        identity, or validate payment or settlement methods), and we may process
        your data and transfer it to these third parties. You hereby explicitly
        consent to: our use of such third-party service providers, the
        outsourcing of services to them, and the related transfer and processing
        of data. Where applicable so we can provide you with the described
        payment functionality, you hereby waive any professional secrecy rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        You authorize the Company and our affiliates to verify information you
        provide to us, such as by verifying the existence of your bank account
        and obtaining reports from third-party sources, such as banks, credit
        agencies, data brokers, and other service providers. We reserve the
        right to close, suspend, or limit your account or rescind your access to
        the Marketplace in the event we are unable to obtain or verify any of
        this information. You agree that the Company is not responsible for any
        losses suffered by you as a result of incomplete or inaccurate
        information you provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some services on the Marketplace involve the use of the Zeitgeist
        parachain, Kusama blockchains or another blockchain, which may require
        that you pay a fee, for example &ldquo;Gas Charges or Transaction
        Fee&rdquo;, for the computational resources required to perform a
        transaction. You acknowledge and agree that the Company has no control
        over external fees. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a
        sufficient balance stored on your Wallet (or sufficient balance in an
        applicable cryptocurrency) to complete any transaction on the
        Marketplace before initiating such transactions. If you do not agree
        with the fees charged for Marketplace functionality, do not use or
        access the Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Marketplace allows for the creation of both permissioned and
        permissionless markets. In each instance, along with submitting the
        requisite information necessary to populate a market with information
        (posing a question, providing outcomes, designating an oracle and
        setting an end date) users creating a market will be required to post a
        bond in the form of ZTG. Permissionless markets (which do not receive
        authorization in advance of the posting of the market on the
        Marketplace) often require a higher bond. You agree that by accessing
        the Marketplace and posting bond to create a market, you will forfeit
        rights to such bond in the event that the market resolved to an outcome
        that is &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; or of the market fails to resolve as a
        result of the users actions or inactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        All participants in the Marketplace must have a payment method on file
        when interacting with the Marketplace and pay all fees and applicable
        taxes associated with our services by the payment due date. If your
        payment method fails or your account is past due, we may collect amounts
        owed by charging other payment methods on file with us, retain
        collection agencies and legal counsel, or suspend or limit services. If
        applicable, you may be subject to late fees. Company, or the collection
        agencies we retain, may also report information about your account to
        credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or
        other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
        If you wish to dispute the information Company reported to a credit
        bureau (i.e., Experian&trade;, Equifax&trade; or TransUnion&trade;)
        please contact us at support@zeitgeist.pm. If you wish to dispute the
        information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding
        your Company account, you must contact the collection agency directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all
        applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in
        connection with your payment methods. You understand that some third
        parties, including credit and debit card issuers, payments services
        providers, and others, may have their own applicable terms and
        conditions for the payment methods you choose to use. Failure to follow
        such third party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you
        (for example, currency conversion fees) or other actions taken by such
        third parties, and you agree that Company has no control over, or
        responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions
      </p>
      <p>
        We may display third-party advertisements (including links and
        references thereto) or other content in any part of our Marketplace, in
        our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction,
        or other credit to any users or participants in the Marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        If applicable, your &ldquo;<strong>Payable Currency</strong>&rdquo; is
        the currency that we will use for settling your transaction proceeds to
        your financial account. We will generally determine your Payable
        Currency as follows, unless you and we agree otherwise: If you are
        residing or established in New Zealand, or any country not listed below,
        your Payable Currency is the US Dollar; If you are residing or
        established in an EEA country (except Iceland), your Payable Currency
        will be the Euro; If you are residing or established in the United
        Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, or Australia, your Payable Currency
        will be based on your country of residence; If you are a seller residing
        or established in Canada, your Payable Currency will be the Canadian
        Dollar or, if offered by us and selected by you, the US Dollar. We may
        enable further Payable Currencies at our sole discretion in the future.
        When this happens, the paid amount will be converted into your Payable
        Currency prior to disbursement of the funds to you, using the applicable
        transaction exchange rate and assessing any applicable currency
        conversion charge as indicated on our Fee Schedule. Similarly, your
        receipt of services from Company may cause you to incur fees which are
        published in a currency other than your Payable Currency; if this
        happens, we may convert such fees into your Payable Currency in the same
        manner as described above. Please note, there is no guaranteed rate of
        conversion of ZTG into any other fungible currency and that all
        transfers and transactions of ZTG will be based on the market prices at
        the time of transfer on the medium transacted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to manage risk or secure your obligations under this Terms of
        Use, we reserve the right at our reasonable discretion to require that
        you maintain a minimum reserve of transaction proceeds not available for
        disbursement (in the form of a fixed or rolling reserve) as a means of
        security. We will notify you of any reserves we require of you.
        Depending on your performance and the risk associated with your use of
        the Marketplace, a reserve may be raised, lowered, or removed at any
        time; if required by law, we will give you prior notice of such changes.

          <u>Risks</u>
        </strong>
        .&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of the Marketplace may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are a
        novel and relatively experimental technology. Their value, if any, can
        fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions conducted with Digital
        Assets are irreversible. Digital Assets and smart contracts are
        typically described using extremely technical language that is difficult

        science. Functionality made available on the Marketplace may have
        inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not
